##  A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SCALA

* It’s a modern jvm platform programming language created by Martin Odersky (the father of javac), and influenced by Java, Ruby, Smalltalk, ML, Haskell, Erlang, and others.

* It's a high level language

* It’s statically typed

* It’s syntax is concise but still readable — we call it expressive

* It’s a pure object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Every variable is an object, and every operator is a method.

* It’s also a functional programming (FP) language, so functions are also variables, and we can pass them into other functions. We can write our code using OOP, FP, or combine them in a hybrid style.

* It has a sophisticated type inference system

* It has traits, which are a combination of interfaces and abstract classes that can be used as mixins, and support a modular programming style

* Scala source code compiles to .class files that run on the JVM.

* Scala also works extremely well with the thousands of Java libraries that have been developed over the years.

* A great thing about Scala is that we can be productive with it soon, but it’s also a deep language, so as we go along we’ll keep learning, and finding newer, better ways to write code. It’s said that Scala will change the way we think about programming (and that’s a good thing).

* Of all of Scala’s benefits, what we like best is that it lets we write concise, readable code. The time a programmer spends reading code compared to the time spent writing code is said to be at least a 10:1 ratio, so writing code that’s concise and readable is a big deal. Because Scala has these attributes, programmers say that it’s expressive.

* The [Akka library] (https://akka.io/) provides an Actors API, which was originally based on the actors concurrency model built into Erlang

* The [Play Framework] (https://www.playframework.com/) is a lightweight, stateless, web development framework that’s built with Scala and Akka. (In addition to Play there are several other popular web frameworks.)
