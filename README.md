##  A FEW IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SCALA

* It’s a modern jvm platform programming language created by Martin Odersky (the father of javac), and influenced by Java, Ruby, Smalltalk, ML, Haskell, Erlang, and others.

* It's a high level language

* It’s statically typed

* It’s syntax is concise but still readable — we call it expressive

* It’s a pure object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Every variable is an object, and every operator is a method.

* It’s also a functional programming (FP) language, so functions are also variables, and we can pass them into other functions. We can write our code using OOP, FP, or combine them in a hybrid style.

* It has a sophisticated type inference system

* It has traits, which are a combination of interfaces and abstract classes that can be used as mixins, and support a modular programming style

* Scala source code compiles to .class files that run on the JVM.

* Scala also works extremely well with the thousands of Java libraries that have been developed over the years.

* The [Akka library] (https://akka.io/) provides an Actors API, which was originally based on the actors concurrency model built into Erlang.
